## Contracts to the Geospatial Centroid

The Geospatial Centroid is a service and contracting center at Colorado State University.
We specialize in geospatial analysis, undergraduate internship training, and
broad cartography.
In Winter of 2020, I transitioned into the role of Faculty Director of the Centroid. As a service
center on campus, we operate primarily with funds from external and internal
clients, below is a quick summary of our contract growth under my leadership. 

$\linebreak[2]$

- FY 21 - Total Contracts ~ $95,000
- FY 22 - Total Contracts ~ $185,000
- FY 23 - Total Contracts ~ $265,000
- FY 24 (as of Aug 2023) ~ $355,000
